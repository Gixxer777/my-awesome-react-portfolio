        My name is David Gaspard and I am a newly minted full stack developer! I have a background in sales and the service industry, but I have always had
        a passion for technology. With my background in sales and the service industry, I have a strong understanding of how to work with people. I would make
        a great addition to any team and can generally fulfill a task if I am asked to do it! I have a can-do attitude, am very adaptable, and also very dependable,
        which makes me an easy person to work with!

        I have an Associates of Arts in Business from Lonestar Community College and am a recent graduate of the University of Texas Coding Bootcamp. With my degree in 
        business I acquired skills in accounting, marketing, and management. Many of these skills are transferable to the tech industry and I am excited to see where 
        my career takes me! I am currently looking for a full time position as a starting level full stack developer, but I am also open to taking on part time work or 
        taking on an apprenticeship as well!
